Thyroid Data Analysis using Looker Studio (formaly-Google Data Studio)

first we will perform some data cleaning using excel
1.Replaced the blanks and undefined values by 'Unknown'
2.Segregated the Start Date and Start time


Now after cleaning the data I have created the Dashboard and gether some insights
1. Got the percentage of patients how called for the first time checkup (the insight is that we got the number of new cases of thyroid patients during that particular time period).
2. From the second pie chart we can see the percentage of particular reason patients are calling for.(insight her is that we have a large number of pending test result so our next step should have to be focused on distobuting the test result ASAP)
3. If we see the 3rd figure(the bar graph), we can clearly see the patients employed in Health Care.(insight we got from this bar graph is that we exactly know how many of the patients are from Health care background we)
4. When we look towards the time series chart we can have knowledge of how many patients we got in which time of the year.(Number of cases have increased as the reany season kicks-in)
5. The map and the heatmap here represent the state wise distribution of the number of the Thyroid patients.(the number of patients is higher in densely populated states)



Certainly! Here's a redrafted version for presentation to business stakeholders:

"After meticulously cleaning and analyzing the data, I am delighted to present the key insights derived from our efforts in creating the dashboard:

1. **New Patient Trends:**
   - By examining the percentage of patients who called for their initial checkup, we've successfully identified a surge in new cases of thyroid patients during this specific time frame.

2. **Reasons for Patient Calls:**
   - Our second pie chart reveals the primary reasons patients are reaching out. Notably, a significant proportion is attributed to pending test results. So, our strategic focus should be on speed up the distribution of test results.

3. **Employment Insights:**
   - The third figure, presented as a bar graph, provides a clear view of patients employed in the healthcare sector. This insightful data allows us to precisely understand the composition of patients with a background in healthcare so these patients are well informed ones, we can communicate with them more effectively, it will be easier to put then in a compliance. Leveraging these advantages can enhance the overall quality of healthcare services provided and contribute to a positive reputation

4. **Seasonal Patient Patterns:**
   - A comprehensive analysis of the time series chart unveils patterns in patient inflow throughout the year. We observe a noticeable increase in cases coinciding with the rainy season, during the mnth of july there are about 20k daily patients.

5. **Geographical Distribution:**
   - The map and heatmap visually represent the state-wise distribution of thyroid patients. Our findings indicate higher concentrations in densely populated states, offering valuable insights into regional healthcare demands.

These insights provide a comprehensive understanding of our data and lay the foundation for informed decision-making. As we move forward, leveraging these findings will be crucial in developing targeted strategies and enhancing our overall healthcare service delivery."
