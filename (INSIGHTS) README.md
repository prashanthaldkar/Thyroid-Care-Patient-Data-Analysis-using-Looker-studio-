"After meticulously cleaning and analyzing the data, I am delighted to present the key insights derived from our efforts in creating the dashboard:

1. **New Patient Trends:**
   - By examining the percentage of patients who called for their initial checkup, we've successfully identified a surge in new cases of thyroid patients during this specific time frame.

2. **Reasons for Patient Calls:**
   - Our second pie chart reveals the primary reasons patients are reaching out. Notably, a significant proportion is attributed to pending test results. So, our strategic focus should be on speed up the distribution of test results.

3. **Employment Insights:**
   - The third figure, presented as a bar graph, provides a clear view of patients employed in the healthcare sector. This insightful data allows us to precisely understand the composition of patients with a background in healthcare so these patients are well informed ones, we can communicate with them more effectively, it will be easier to put then in a compliance. Leveraging these advantages can enhance the overall quality of healthcare services provided and contribute to a positive reputation

   - The map and heatmap visually represent the state-wise distribution of thyroid patients. Our findings indicate higher concentrations in densely populated states, offering valuable insights into regional healthcare demands.

These insights provide a comprehensive understanding of our data and lay the foundation for informed decision-making. As we move forward, leveraging these findings will be crucial in developing targeted strategies and enhancing our overall healthcare service delivery."
